| Explanation           	| Who is responsible for the creation of the original work?  If a manuscript document, who wrote it? If a photograph, who took the picture?  If an oral history, who is the subject (the interviewee)?  And so on.  We enter this in the manner traditionally used in cataloging records: last name first, and we check the Library of Congress name authority file, a controlled vocabulary of names of people, and use the form found there, if available.  One difference from MARC cataloging is that multiple authors of a work can be recorded in this field.                      	|
