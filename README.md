Metadata dictionary and best practices for the Digital Library at the University of Utah

As a partner of the [Mountain West Digital Library](https://mwdl.org/), our local practices strive to be in conformance with the MWDL Application Profile. Specific examples and instructions are local to our institution. This metadata dictionary is currently a work in progress, and has not been finalized.

This document is inspired by the [Carnegie Hall Digital Collections Metadata Application Profile](https://carnegiehall.github.io/digitalcolls-metadataprofile/)
